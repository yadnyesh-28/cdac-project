                The test is done to check the vulva, ovaries, cervix, uterus, and also rectum in a pregnant woman. It is generally performed during the first or third trimester of pregnancy.

                The truth is that getting a Pap smear is safe for you and your baby; it will not cause a miscarriage. Whether you're pregnant or not, the Pap smear is the gold standard for screening for cervical cancer. It allows us to collect cells from the surface of the cervix and examine them for abnormalities.

                <p>
                Screening for bacterial vaginosis involves taking a swab of the vaginal area and looking for the presence of bacterial vaginosisâ€“related bacteria. This can be done by looking under the microscope for these bacterial cells or by molecular testing the sample for bacterial components.

                </h4>
                <p>
                This test uses sound waves to make pictures of the inside of the body. To capture the images, a device called a transducer might be pressed against the stomach area. Or it may be placed into the vagina in a version of the exam called transvaginal ultrasound. Both types of the test may be done to get the best view of the reproductive organs. A standard ultrasound won't confirm whether you have endometriosis. But it can find cysts linked with the condition called endometriomas.

                <p>
                This exam uses a magnetic field and radio waves to make images of the organs and tissues within the body. For some, an MRI helps with surgical planning. It gives your surgeon detailed information about the location and size of endometriosis growths.

                <p>
                In some cases, you may be referred to a surgeon for this procedure. Laparoscopy lets the surgeon check inside your abdomen for signs of endometriosis tissue. Before the surgery, you receive medicine that puts you a sleep-like state and prevents pain. Then your surgeon makes a tiny cut near your navel and inserts a slender viewing instrument called a laparoscope.
